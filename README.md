Credit Card Clustering
Overview :-
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at clustering credit card customers based on their spending behavior and account characteristics. The project utilizes the KMeans clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups, allowing for targeted marketing strategies and personalized financial services.

Dataset :- 
The dataset used in this project includes various features related to credit card usage and customer behavior. The key features are as follows:

-CUST_ID: Unique identifier for each customer
-BALANCE: Current balance on the credit card
-BALANCE_FREQUENCY: Frequency of balance updates
-PURCHASES: Total purchases made by the customer
-ONEOFF_PURCHASES: Total one-off purchases made
-INSTALLMENTS_PURCHASES: Total purchases made in installments
-CASH_ADVANCE: Total cash advances taken
-PURCHASES_FREQUENCY: Frequency of purchases made
-ONEOFF_PURCHASES_FREQUENCY: Frequency of one-off purchases
-PURCHASES_INSTALLMENTS_FREQUENCY: Frequency of installment purchases
-CASH_ADVANCE_FREQUENCY: Frequency of cash advances
-CASH_ADVANCE_TRX: Number of cash advance transactions
-PURCHASES_TRX: Number of purchase transactions
-CREDIT_LIMIT: Credit limit assigned to the customer
-PAYMENTS: Total payments made by the customer
-MINIMUM_PAYMENTS: Minimum payments required
-PRC_FULL_PAYMENT: Percentage of full payments made
-TENURE: Duration of the credit card account in months


Methodology :- 
1. Data Preparation: The dataset is preprocessed to handle any missing values and to normalize the features, ensuring that all variables contribute equally to the distance calculations used in clustering.
2. Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected for clustering based on their significance in representing customer behavior.
3. KMeans Clustering: The KMeans algorithm is applied to the dataset to group customers into clusters. The number of clusters is determined using methods such as the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to find the optimal number of clusters.
4. Cluster Analysis: After clustering, the characteristics of each cluster are analyzed to understand the different customer segments. This analysis can provide insights into spending habits, payment behaviors, and credit utilization.


Results :-
The results of the clustering can be visualized using various techniques, such as scatter plots or cluster profiles, to illustrate the differences between customer segments. Each cluster can be interpreted to identify potential marketing strategies or risk management approaches.

Conclusion :-
This project demonstrates the application of KMeans clustering for segmenting credit card customers based on their financial behavior. The insights gained from this analysis can help financial institutions tailor their services and marketing efforts to better meet the needs of different customer groups.
